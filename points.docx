Question--> what was the problem with the node?

ANSWER--> 1. Node js code is very complex. 
          2. For every route we need to create a seprate route using switch.
          3. In node we handle HTTP methods(get post etc) separately which is a pain itself.
          4. for different use we need to create different packages like for using "url" we need
                to create url package, similarly for header, http and json.


Express js--> Express JS is the framework for node js for writing and managing handlers

npm install express 
--> it will craete package.json file

import express-->
const express = require("express")

1. express makes code clear, modular and helps us to handle routes easily.
2. express creates server without using http module. It uses HTTP module internally.
3. app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
4. app is an instance of express.
5. METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercas
6. PATH is the path on the server.
7. HANDLER is the function thats need to be excuted when the route is mathed.
