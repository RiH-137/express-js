For POST, PATCH, Delete we use postman

POSTMAN is tool helps in API testing and docx maintaining.

In postman "200 OK" means all things are running good on the postman.

In postman, select post and past the url; after that see the posted data
and now click on post and select "x-wwwform-urlencoded" option and now we can set that from there only.

middleware--> convert the body in JS object and pu it into the datafile.
